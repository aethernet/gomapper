# Go experiments around a shader based pixel mapper

PoC implementation in p5.ps : https://github.com/Drunk-Developper/absolute-crazy-led-mapper

This is half baked : 

- [x] setup go, glsl, ...
- [x] load shader from file
- [x] render shader
- [x] pass float uniform to shader (time)
- [x] pass texture to shader as uniform
- [x] extract texture data from shader
- [x] chain shaders (send output texture from a shader as input texture for the next)
- [x] refactor code for readability
- [x] render each shader in its own texture
- [x] use proper mapping shaders
- [x] extract pixels from mapping texture
- [x] generate artnet or sACN udp packages
- [ ] basic debug UI [draw mapping lines on top of screen]
- [ ] fix broken mapping
- [ ] make it run on a jetson nano
- [Â ] make basic control UI
- [ ] add mask generator
- [ ] add isf support
- [ ] add automatic OSC -> ISF controls


Current limitations (todo for later):
- Only send 1 universe

Notes : 
- frag shader 1 coordinate doens't requires a /2, while we do it on frag shader2 before displaying (the logic behind this escapes me atm, but it works)
